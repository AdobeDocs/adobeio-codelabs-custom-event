# Getting Started with Adobe I/O Custom Event

The I/O Events SDK is an open-source SDK for the use of third party customers. Third-party APIs in CSM requires bare minimum information from the users so that they can register providers and event metadata with ease, and register a webhook or journalling endpoint and listen to events. They can then start publishing messages to the event receiver for their org and then listen to those events by either polling via journalling or by allowing the webhook to be notified about events. 

The Events SDK provides a wrapper over these API calls making it easier for developers to use it as part of their apps and get started with I/O Events. 

In this lab, you will learn how to use I/O Events SDK:
* Register a provider
* Register the event metadata
* Ensure that these events are published to Adobe I/O events in cloud events format
* Register a webhook / journalling endpoint to comsume event
