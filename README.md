# Getting Started with Adobe I/O Custom Event

Adobe I/O events SDK is an open-source SDK for the use of third party customers. Adobe I/O Events allows you to build reactive, event-driven applications, based on events originating from various Adobe services. Events are triggered by event providers and can be listened to by journalling or by registering a webhook

The events SDK provides a wrapper over these API calls making it easier for developers to use it as part of their apps and get started with I/O Events. 

In this lab, you will learn how to use I/O events SDK:
* Register a provider
* Register the event metadata
* Ensure that these events are published to Adobe I/O events 
* Register a webhook or journalling endpoint to consume event
