## Lesson 2: Register the App as Event Provider 

After the you have your app ready now you can register the app as event provider. 
### Set up project and use CLI to register the app as event provider
After set up your integration and collect the informations, you can start set up your event provider

#### Use CLI to create provider, eventmetadata and webhook registration

Now we can start using CLI to create provider, eventmetadata and webhook registration.
Make sure you install the Adobe I/O Events CLI Plugin, then run the below commands:

```bash
aio console org list
aio console org select <orgId>
aio console project list
aio console project select <projectid>
aio console workspace list
aio console workspace select <wkspId>
aio app use
aio event => this will list all the commands for events.
```

### Register the Event Provider
After select the org, project and workspace, now we start to create registration 
```bash
aio event provider create
```
Fill in the information, and in the terminal you will see the provider id after successfully create provider,copy the `provider id` for next steps, now we can create eventmetadata:
```bash
aio event eventmetadata create <provider id>
```
CLI will promote you to the questions asking you to input the `label` and `event code`for the eventmetadata.
Now you can create registration by:
```bash
aio event registration create 
```
It will show you a sample of JSON format with the information to create a new event registration
which you can copy, create your `.json` file and fill in details and use it. 

Now with all that we have finished registering the event provider.

Note: another option to register an event provider is to run javascript code
For your convenience,the source code is available [here](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adobeio-codelab-event-provider-registration)
simply fill in the `.env` and run `npm start` 

### Check your result on Console
After using event SDK to create an event provider, you will see event provider registrated in console 
as well as your jouranling end point
